                        <p>The PetSafe Rechargeable Dog Fence is a quality containment system
                            recommended for small to
                            large dogs on suburban properties. Whether you need to keep your dog
                            safe in your
                            yard&nbsp;or prevent them from digging up the gardens (or both), you can
                            customise your
                            pet's containment layout for peace of mind - 24/7.</p>
                        <p>Unlike other&nbsp;fence collars in the PetSafe range that use replaceable

                            of&nbsp;batteries. The collar
                            receiver collar will achieve a full charge in 2-3 hours and each charge
                            lasts up to 2 months
                            depending on use.&nbsp;The collar has&nbsp;4&nbsp;adjustable levels of
                            low to medium static
                            electric stimulations recommended for pet dogs above 6 months old with a
                            mild to medium
                            temperament. The fence contains an unlimited number of pets providing
                            they are wearing
                            compatible receiver collars, and covers up to 25 acres with additional

                        <p>The transmitter sends an AM radio signal through the wire and around your
                            property. This
                            radio signal&nbsp;communicates with your dog's receiver collar. When
                            your dog approaches the
                            boundary wire, the collar will deliver a warning tone. If your dog
                            ignores this warning tone
                            and proceeds towards the boundary wire into the correction field, the
                            collar will deliver a
                            safe static stimulation to remind your dog to stay in the 'safe zone'.
                            The collar also has a
                            run-through prevention feature that automatically increases the
                            stimulation levels if your
                            dog tries to run through the boundary.</p>
