                        <h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>PetSafe Rechargeable Dog Fence -
                                    PIG19-16413</strong></span></h2>
                        <p>The PetSafe Rechargeable Dog Fence is a quality containment system recommended for small to
                            large dogs on suburban properties. Whether you need to keep your dog safe in your
                            yard or prevent them from digging up the gardens (or both), you can customise your
                            pet's containment layout for peace of mind - 24/7.</p>
                        <p>Unlike other fence collars in the PetSafe range that use replaceable batteries, the
                            <strong>PIG19-16414 receiver collar</strong> included with this
                            fence is rechargeable, saving you the ongoing cost of batteries. The collar
                            receiver collar will achieve a full charge in 2-3 hours and each charge lasts up to 2 months
                            depending on use. The collar has 4 adjustable levels of low to medium static
                            electric stimulations recommended for pet dogs above 6 months old with a mild to medium
                            temperament. The fence contains an unlimited number of pets providing they are wearing
                            compatible receiver collars, and covers up to 25 acres with additional boundary wire.</p>
                        <p><strong>Please note: </strong>All<strong>&nbsp;</strong>PetSafe, SportDOG and Dogtra Fences
                            run an AM radio signal through the wire. This AM signal may be affected or warped by
                            Colobond fencing and other sheet metal.</p>
                        <h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>How the PetSafe Rechargeable Dog Fence
                                    Works</strong></span></h2>
                        <p>The transmitter sends an AM radio signal through the wire and around your property. This
                            radio signal communicates with your dog's receiver collar. When your dog approaches the
                            boundary wire, the collar will deliver a warning tone. If your dog ignores this warning tone
                            and proceeds towards the boundary wire into the correction field, the collar will deliver a
                            safe static stimulation to remind your dog to stay in the 'safe zone'. The collar also has a
                            run-through prevention feature that automatically increases the stimulation levels if your
                            dog tries to run through the boundary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important -&nbsp;</strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dog
                                    containment fence systems are a very effective form of keeping your dog in the
                                    yard as long as&nbsp;they know how to react to the warning tone and static
                                    stimulation. Training is required.</p>
